finding significant variable 

input layer --> hiden layer --> output layer--> weight an bais --> activation function --> loss function

**neuron is input point 

**layer is storing the at particular neuron befoor parsing it to the next layer
each neauron is mathemtical opperation that takes its input multiplies it by the weight assosiated with the input  and 
passes the sum through the activation function to the other neuron


**activation function 
it is normalizing the computed input to produce an output

**feedforward neural network 
the weight are taken randomly and the output is calculated using the activation function

add an       add weight      add an       calculate the       predict the 
input   -->    and       --> output  -->  weighted sum  -->   output using    
layer         bais           layer        of inputs         activation function
 

**backpropagation
is the process wher eweight are updated to minimize the calculated error

calculate     use gradient     update     update      do this for
  the     -->   descent    --> weight  --> bais   --> n iteration
 error         algorithm                              for accurency

**error 
is the theffrence betwin the pridected output and the real output
